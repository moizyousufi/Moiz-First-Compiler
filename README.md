# Individual Project

This repository/assignment is a starting point for your semester-long, individual language implementation project.
Over the course of the semester, we will introduce various milestones prompting you to add to your implementation.
You should complete all of your work in this repository, using good `git` practices throughout development, _e.g._, commiting and pushing changes periodically.
If you need help with using Git, check out this [Mini-course/repository on using Git and Github](https://github.com/csc312-grinnell/github-starter-course).


# Typescript Template

This repository was built from a custom-built template for a console-based [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) program designed for editing in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
Below, we outline the contents of the template for your reference if you need to build your own Typescript project.

## Package Management

We use [NPM](https://npmjs.com) for package management.
The package is initialized with:

~~~console
$> npm init
~~~

With default values given for the `package.json` file that is created.
In particular, a few scripts/sub-commands are given so that building, testing, _etc._, can be run via `npm run`.
See `package.json` to see what these commands do.

Note that the template uses the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org) license which is replicated in `LICENSE`.
We recommend that you change the license as needed.

## Typescript

The Typescript compiler is installed as a (local) npm development package via `npm`:

~~~console
$> npm install typescript --save-dev
~~~

Development packages are packages that only used during program development, not program execution.

`tsconfig.json` contains default options to the Typescript compiler, `tsc`.
In particular, we specify that source files are contained in the `/src` directory and output files are placed in the `/dist` directory.
See the [tsconfig refeence](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig) for more information on these options.

## ESLint

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to lint our code.
When coupled with appropriate Visual Studio Code plugin, ESLint provides strong support to enforce style and healthy code practices during development.
We installed `eslint` via the `eslint/config` helper tool:

~~~console
$> npm init @eslint/config
~~~

Arbitrarily, we chose the [Javascript Standard](https://standardjs.com) style for ESLint to enforce.
Feel free to customize this style template or choose a different style altogether.
`.eslintrc.js` contains these settings and the [ESLint user guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/) provides a comprehensive reference for the file.

## Jest

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io) as a testing framework for Typescript projects.
There are many such frameworks available; we choose Jest both because of its popularity and its ease of setup and use.

~~~console
$> npm install --save-dev jest ts-jest @types/jest
$> npx ts-jest config:init
~~~

The last command adds a Jest configuration file, `jest.config.js`, to the project.

## Devcontainer Configuration

The `/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file configures the runtime instance created when the project is loaded within a Github Codespace.
The file is the default configuration file provided by Microsoft in its [Node.js container template](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-node) with appropriate modifications for these kinds of projects.

Notably, if this project is run in a local version of Visual Studio Code, we recommend installing the following plugins to manage your work:

+   [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
+   [Github Classroom](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.classroom)

## Git Configuration

`.gitignore` is pre-populated so that Git ignores all build files generated by the project.


# Initial Language Proposal Design

I want to write a general-purpose statically typed language. Moreover, I would like for this to follow the object-oriented paradigm if that is possible within the span of this semester (otherwise, I will make it follow the imperative paradigm). Initially, I had an idea to create a programming language compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, similarly to Solidity, although I realize that would probably take longer than this semester to complete, so instead I want to get a feel for how object-oriented languages are written. Ideally, this language will have classes, interfaces, methods, attributes, and, of course, objects. Moreover, I would like to implement inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism. I would also like to at least consider how a garbage collector might work in the context of this course whenever I have to think about memory management for the language. I will use TypeScript to make this project. Ideally, I would prefer if this language does not use semicolons, but still has brackets.

As for my personal motivation to do this, I am mostly interested in understanding the object-oriented paradigm and familiarizing myself with how a general-purpose language is written. I want to branch out and make something interesting after taking this course; for instance, we know that Java is a fairly slow language and developers that need a fast language under the object-oriented language typically will choose C++. I want to understand the principles that make Java slow and C++ much faster. Moreover, if I write a language compatible with the EVM, smart contracts work in a similar fashion to classes in OOP languages so it would be best if I understand the OOP paradigm for creating such a project. Mostly, I think this project would be useful for future projects I might make.

# Preliminary Formal Grammar

t ::= int | double | bool | char | Obj

NOTE: I plan on representing strings as an array of characters, not an object

e ::= t | !!!e | e1 &&& e2 | e1 ||| e2 | e1 === e2| e1 !== e2 | if e1 e2 e3 | e1 + e2 | e1 - e2 | e1 * e2 | e1 / e2 | e1 ^ e2

I want to use three operator symbols for any operation that outputs a boolean (with the exception of if), and one operation for number operations. I have not considered any object relationships yet, but I will think about that going into the future.


# Final Language Design

I made many changes to my language. I ended up scrapping what I had and restarting entirely, making the entirity of the updated language in less than two weeks, because I needed to fundamentally change my design style if I wanted to implement sensible syntax. For now, I've made a language that only has addition, but with integers and floating point values. I have successfully implemented objects with single inheritence based off of a prototype model. Based off what I have, the language does not particularly require semicolons, but it is optional, as a special feature I decided to add. Here is how the language is structured:

Suppose a,b are integers. Suppose c,d are floating point values.
a + b is valid
a + c is valid
c + d is valid

Parentheses are also supported to work as expected.

To initialize an object with values x and y, you would type:

{ x : 0 , y : 5 }

which sets x to be 0 and y to be 5

Moreover, you can use inheritence as follows:

{ x : 0 , y : 5 , { z : 10 } }

To declare variables, I have created the 'Define' operator to be used for a variable x as follows:

Define x 5

Or if we want to define an object y:

Define y { a : 20 , b : 30 }

And we can summon these variables with a 'Call' operator as follows:

Define x 5

Call x

This will return 5.

We can also summon the elements of an object with the 'Call' operator as follows:

Define y { a : 20 , b : 30 }

Call y . b

This will return 20.

# Future Steps

I plan on adding subtraction, multiplication, division, booleans, if-else statements, boolean operators, and public/privacy modifiers to the language going into the future, but these were things I simply did not have enough time to implement within less than two weeks, so I've gone ahead and submitted as is.
